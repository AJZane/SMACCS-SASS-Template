//Sprites

//COMPASS guide to sprites: http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/

//You have two options for generating your sprites

//Place your sprite pieces in a folder within the /styles-precompile/img directory.
//For example: These sprite pieces are located in styles-precompile/img/sprite_folder
// @import "sprite_folder/*.png"

//The second option is to generate the sprite file manually with: compass sprite "sprite_folder/*.png"
//This will create a 'sprites' directory within styles-precompile, and a SCSS file named '_sprite_folder.scss'
//Import that scss file. Once you compile, the spritesheet will be created in 'images/sprites/'
// @import "../sprites/sprite_folder"
